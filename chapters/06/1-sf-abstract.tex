This chapter presents \textit{Segmentflow}, a segmentation workflow tool
that can be used to generate geometries for use in image-based
physics simulations.
The capabilities of \textit{Segmentflow} are demonstrated
by presenting the process of creating surface meshes
from a CT scan of a mock high explosives system consisting of tens of
thousands of F50 sand grains coated in a Kel-F polymeric binder.
Segmented particles are produced from segmentations seeded in five different
ways. Each segmentation is analyzed to assess the accuracy compared to
typical F50 sand.
Surface meshes are created from the segmented particles resulting from
the segmentation with the lowest error. An example surface mesh is subject to
a variety of postprocessing and the resulting surfaces are compared.
This postprocessing exhibits the important ability of\textit{Segmentflow}
to control the complexity that geometry introduces to simulations.
