The 'section topo- graphs' so obtained show imperfections in the interior of the crystal. With this technique it was discovered that individual dislocations can be detected by X-ray diffrac- tion (Lang, 1957b, 1958). However, a large number of section topographs must be compared in order to build up a picture of the spatial distribution of imperfections in the crystal. To obtain this information more readily a new method of diffraction microradiography has been developed which shows directly the imperfection distribu- tion in the specimen volume under investigation.

The solidification sequence of the alloys formed by the dissolution process was also observed. Sodium is very difficult to analyse metallographically, using optical microscopy or electron beam techniques, due to the high reactivity of sodium with the water vapour present in the air. In this work, a method was evolved for observing the behaviour of liquid sodium, when used as a solvent in dissolution experiments, utilizing X-radiography. Sample cans were irradiated with a beam of X-rays and the transmitted beam fell on a fluorescent screen image intensifier. This was either viewed directly using a closed-circuit TV system or recorded using video recording equipment. In the future it is hoped to extend this work to other light-heavy metal systems such as the Al-Cu alloys.},

However, most existing watershed algorithms are either too time consuming or insufficiently accurate. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new and flexible implementation of this transformation. It is based on a progressive flooding of the picture and it works for n-dimensional images. Pixels are first sorted in the increasing order of their gray values. Then, the successive gray levels are processed in order to simulate the flooding propagation. A distributive sorting technique combined with breadth-first scannings of each gray level allow an extremely fast computation. Furthermore, the present algorithm is very general since it deals with any kind of digital grid and its extension to general graphs is straightforward. Its interest with respect to image segmentation is illustrated by the extraction of geometrical shapes from a noisy image, the separation of 3-dimensional overlapping particles and by the segmentation of a digital elevation model using watersheds on images and graphs.},

The present algorithm is based on an immersion process analogy, in which the flooding of the water in the picture is efficiently simulated using a queue of pixels. It is described in detail and provided in a pseudo C language. We prove the accuracy of this algorithm is superior to that of the existing implementations. Furthermore, it is shown that its adaptation to any kind of digital grid and its generalization to n-dimensional images and even to graphs are straightforward. In addition, its strongest point is that it is faster than any other watershed algorithm. Applications of this algorithm with regard to picture segmentation are presented for MR imagery and for digital elevation models. An example of 3-D watershed is also provided. Lastly, some ideas are given on how to solve complex segmentation tasks using watersheds on graphs.},

In order to study the detailed dynamics of the solidification process, we develop the technologies needed for real-time Xray microscopy of solidifying metallic systems, which has not previously been feasible with the necessary resolution, speed, and contrast. In initial studies of Al-ln monotectic alloys unidirectionally solidified in an X-ray transparent furnace,in situ records of the evolution of interface morphologies, interfacial solute accumulation, and formation of the monotectic droplets were obtained for the first time: A radiomicrograph of Al-30In grown during aircraft parabolic maneuvers is presented, showing the volumetric phase distribution in this specimen. The benefits of using X-ray microscopy for postsolidification metallography include ease of specimen preparation, increased sensitivity, and three-dimensional analysis of phase distribution. Imaging of the solute boundary layer revealed that the isoconcentration lines are not parallel (as is often assumed) to the growth interface. Striations in the solidified crystal did not accurately decorate the interface position and shape. The monotectic composition alloy under some conditions grew in an uncoupled manner.},

To control processing time, it is often desirable to use approximations in place of excessively detailed models. We have developed a surface simplification algorithm which can rapidly produce high quality approximations of polygonal models. The algorithm uses iterative contractions of vertex pairs to simplify models and maintains surface error approximations using quadric matrices. By contracting arbitrary vertex pairs (not just edges), our algorithm is able to join unconnected regions of models. This can facilitate much better approximations, both visually and with respect to geometric error. In order to allow topological joining, our system also supports non-manifold surface models.},

Such processing maps are helpful for the control of the solidification microstructure. As examples, two processes are discussed: the epitaxial laser metal forming (E-LMF) process where a single crystalline superalloy part is repaired in single crystal form and equiaxed grains have to be avoided; and the arc welding of aluminium alloys where equiaxed grains are the preferred solidification structure. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

   abstract = {In digital imaging of discrete particles, such as stone aggregates, segmentation is one of the most important processes. Automated scanners of different designs use cameras or lasers to obtain digital images of groups of aggregate particles. To accurately determine particle size and shape parameters, each particle region in the image must be isolated and processed individually. Here, a method for segmenting a particle image acquired from laser profiling is developed using a Canny edge detector and a watershed transformation. Canny edges with rigorous and liberal threshold values are used to outline particle boundaries on a binary image and to check the validity of watersheds, respectively. To find appropriate regional minima in the watershed transformation, a varying search window method is used, where the number of neighboring pixels being compared with the pixel of interest is determined from the height value of the pixel. Test results with this method are promising. When implemented in automated systems that are designed to rapidly assess size and shape characteristics of stone particles, this technique can not only reduce the amount of time required for aggregate preparation, but also increase the accuracy of analysis results.},

It is well known that properties of the grown material are largely controlled by the microstructures left in the solid during processing. Thus, a precise mastering of the solidification is essential to tailor products in a reproducible fashion to a specified quality. One major difficulty for this study is the real-time and in situ observation of the interface, especially for metallic alloys. A possibility is to use an intense and coherent third generation x-ray beam. By combining different x-ray imaging techniques (absorption/phase contrast radiography and diffraction topography), we have studied the directional melting and solidification of aluminium-based alloys. The preliminary results show the great potential of these techniques for the study of the coupling between stress effects and microstructure formation in solidification processing.},

Edge detection algorithm includes function edge and marker-controlled watershed segmentation. It features the simple algorithm implemented in MATLAB. The watershed segmentation has been proved to be a powerful and fast technique for both contour detection and region-based segmentation. In principle, watershed segmentation depends on ridges to perform a proper segmentation, a property that is often fulfilled in contour detection where the boundaries of the objects are expressed as ridges. For region-based segmentation, it is possible to convert the edges of the objects into ridges by calculating an edge map of the image. Watershed is normally implemented by region growing, based on a set of markers to avoid oversegmentation.},

@article{Tadrous2010,
   abstract = {Aims: The term 'objective' connotes a method that is based on facts and not influenced by personal opinions, perception or emotion. One often reads in the biomedical literature claims of objectivity for methods that use digital image analysis applied to histology. Since objective assessment of histology would represent a huge leap forward in scientific measurement and clinical diagnosis, such claims should be substantiated by strong evidence. This paper takes a selective look at the literature on image analysis to assess the definition of objectivity in image analysis and asks whether such a claim is ever justified. Methods: First, a brief background on the basic science of image analysis in histology details some of the controversies and opinions in the field. Then, a literature review of a subset of papers pertaining to image analysis in histology (with claims of objectivity) is conducted to determine what evidence exists for objectivity in these methods. Results: It was found that image analysis may have many benefits (speed, indefatigability, standardisation, etc.). However, algorithms are devised and implemented by human beings who make subjective decisions at each stage of the algorithm design and implementation process. Thus, image analysis methods can be seen as deterministic processes which 'objectively' implement the subjective decisions of the programmer. This indicates that 'inter-observer' variation in image analysis is equivalent to 'inter-algorithm' variation (which is rarely studied) and that a single computer algorithm's repeatability is of lesser importance than the repeatability of the image analysis method as a whole (including the block, slide and field selection and the method of tissue processing). Conclusion: Repeatability and automaticity must not be confused with objectivity, but a lack of objectivity does not imply a lack of utility. Unless specific evidence of objectivity is provided, editors should insist that claims of objectivity in image analysis papers be either removed or justified prior to publication. © 2010 Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia.},

   abstract = {This study presents a combined experimental and computational effort aimed at high-resolution 3D imaging, visualization, and numerical reconstruction of a fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite microstructure at the constituent-level length scale. A unidirectional sample of graphite/epoxy composite is imaged at sub-micron resolution using a 3D X-ray computed tomography microscope. The numerical reconstruction is enabled by a novel segmentation algorithm, which is developed using concepts adopted from computer vision and multi-target tracking, to detect and estimate with high accuracy the position of individual fibers in a volume of the imaged composite. Results from the segmentation algorithm are compared qualitatively to the tomographic data and suggest high accuracy of the numerical reconstruction. The segmentation data are also used to quantify the relative distribution of fibers within the imaged cross sections of the volume and the local fiber misorientation relative to the global fiber axis. Finally, the segmentation data are converted into a solid model of fibers and surrounding resin, which is then meshed using commercially available finite element (FE) software. A static, linear elastic simulation is performed on NASA's Pleiades supercomputer to quantify the computational cost associated with the high-fidelity, constituent-level, 3D numerical model. The high-fidelity simulation is an important step towards demonstrating the feasibility of an FE-based simulation framework for FRP composites at the constituent length scale.},

   abstract = {Site specific control of the crystallographic orientation of grains within metal components has been unachievable before the advent of metals additive manufacturing (AM) technologies. To demonstrate the capability, the growth of highly misoriented micron scale grains outlining the letters D, O and E, through the thickness of a 25?4 mm tall bulk block comprised of primarily columnar [001] oriented grains made of the nickel base superalloy Inconel 718 was promoted. To accomplish this, electron beam scan strategies were developed based on principles of columnar to equiaxed transitions during solidification. Through changes in scan strategy, the electron beam heat source can rapidly change between point and line heat source modes to promote steady state and/or transient thermal gradients and liquid/solid interface velocity. With this approach, an equiaxed solidification in the regions bounding the letters D, O and E was achieved. The through thickness existence of the equiaxed grain structure outlining the letters within a highly columnar [001] oriented bulk was confirmed through characterizing the bulk specimen with energy selective neutron radiography and confirming with an electron backscatter detection. Ultimately, this demonstration promotes the ability to build metal components with site specific control on crystallographic orientation of grains using the electron beam melting process.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a method to automatically produce plausible image segmentation samples from a single expert segmentation. A probability distribution of image segmentation boundaries is defined as a Gaussian process, which leads to segmentations which are spatially coherent and consistent with the presence of salient borders in the image. The proposed approach is computationally efficient, and generates visually plausible samples. The variability between the samples is mainly governed by a parameter which may be correlated with a simple Dice's coefficient, or easily set by the user from the definition of probable regions of interest. The method is extended to the case of several neighboring structures, but also to account for under or over segmentation, and the presence of excluded regions. We also detail a method to sample segmentations with more general non-stationary covariance functions which relies on supervoxels. Furthermore, we compare the generated segmentation samples with several manual clinical segmentations of a brain tumor. Finally, we show how this approach can have useful applications in the field of uncertainty quantification, and an illustration is provided in radiotherapy planning, where segmentation sampling is applied to both the clinical target volume and the organs at risk.},

   abstract = {As LiCoO2 cathodes are charged, delithiation of the LiCoO2 active material leads to an increase in the lattice spacing, causing swelling of the particles. When these particles are packed into a bicontinuous, percolated network, as is the case in a battery electrode, this swelling leads to the generation of significant mechanical stress. In this study we performed coupled electrochemical-mechanical simulations of the charging of a LiCoO2 cathode in order to elucidate the mechanisms of stress generation and the effect of charge rate and microstructure on these stresses. Energy dispersive spectroscopy combined with scanning electron microscopy imaging was used to create 3D reconstructions of a LiCoO2 cathode, and the Conformal Decomposition Finite Element Method is used to automatically generate computational meshes on this reconstructed microstructure. Replacement of the ideal solution Fickian diffusion model, typically used in battery simulations, with a more general non-ideal solution model shows substantially smaller gradients of lithium within particles than is typically observed in the literature. Using this more general model, lithium gradients only appear at states of charge where the open-circuit voltage is relatively constant. While lithium gradients do affect the mechanical stress state in the particles, the maximum stresses are always found in the fully-charged state and are strongly affected by the local details of the microstructure and particle-to-particle contacts. These coupled electrochemical-mechanical simulations begin to yield insight into the partitioning of volume change between reducing pore space and macroscopically swelling the electrode. Finally, preliminary studies that include the presence of the polymeric binder suggest that it can greatly impact stress generation and that it is an important area for future research.},

@article{imagej,
   abstract = {Background: ImageJ is an image analysis program extensively used in the biological sciences and beyond. Due to its ease of use, recordable macro language, and extensible plug-in architecture, ImageJ enjoys contributions from non-programmers, amateur programmers, and professional developers alike. Enabling such a diversity of contributors has resulted in a large community that spans the biological and physical sciences. However, a rapidly growing user base, diverging plugin suites, and technical limitations have revealed a clear need for a concerted software engineering effort to support emerging imaging paradigms, to ensure the software's ability to handle the requirements of modern science. Results: We rewrote the entire ImageJ codebase, engineering a redesigned plugin mechanism intended to facilitate extensibility at every level, with the goal of creating a more powerful tool that continues to serve the existing community while addressing a wider range of scientific requirements. This next-generation ImageJ, called "ImageJ2" in places where the distinction matters, provides a host of new functionality. It separates concerns, fully decoupling the data model from the user interface. It emphasizes integration with external applications to maximize interoperability. Its robust new plugin framework allows everything from image formats, to scripting languages, to visualization to be extended by the community. The redesigned data model supports arbitrarily large, N-dimensional datasets, which are increasingly common in modern image acquisition. Despite the scope of these changes, backwards compatibility is maintained such that this new functionality can be seamlessly integrated with the classic ImageJ interface, allowing users and developers to migrate to these new methods at their own pace. Conclusions: Scientific imaging benefits from open-source programs that advance new method development and deployment to a diverse audience. ImageJ has continuously evolved with this idea in mind; however, new and emerging scientific requirements have posed corresponding challenges for ImageJ's development. The described improvements provide a framework engineered for flexibility, intended to support these requirements as well as accommodate future needs. Future efforts will focus on implementing new algorithms in this framework and expanding collaborations with other popular scientific software suites.},

We show that the laser-induced gas/vapour jet promotes the formation of melt tracks and denuded zones via spattering (at a velocity of 1 m s-1). We also uncover mechanisms of pore migration by Marangoni-driven flow (recirculating at a velocity of 0.4 m s-1), pore dissolution and dispersion by laser re-melting. We develop a mechanism map for predicting the evolution of melt features, changes in melt track morphology from a continuous hemi-cylindrical track to disconnected beads with decreasing linear energy density and improved molten pool wetting with increasing laser power. Our results clarify aspects of the physics behind LAM, which are critical for its development.},

Powder motion dynamics, as a function of time, environment pressure, and location, is presented. The moving speed, acceleration, and driving force of powder motion that are induced by metal vapor jet/plume and argon gas flow are quantified.

   abstract = {MicroCT is a well-established technique that is used to analyze the interior of objects non-destructively, and it is especially useful for void or porosity analysis. Besides its widespread use, few standards exist and none for additive manufacturing as yet. This is due to the inherent differences in part design, sizes and geometries, which results in different scan resolutions and qualities. This makes direct comparison between different scans of additively manufactured parts almost impossible. In addition, different image analysis methodologies can produce different results. In this method paper, we present a simplified 10 mm cube-shaped coupon sample as a standard size for detailed analysis of porosity using microCT, and a simplified workflow for obtaining porosity information. The aim is to be able to obtain directly comparable porosity information from different samples from the same AM system and even from different AM systems, and to potentially correlate detailed morphologies of the pores or voids with improper process parameters. The method is applied to two examples of different characteristic types of voids in AM: sub-surface lack of fusion due to improper contour scanning, and tree-like pores growing in the build direction. This standardized method demonstrates the capability for microCT to not only quantify porosity, but also identify void types which can be used to improve AM process optimization.},

Commerical graphite anodes are investigated because graphite remains the anode material of choice due to its low cost, mechanical robustness, and suitable electrochemical properties. At the same time, the graphite anode often plays a role in cell degradation and failure, as lithium plating can occur on the graphite anode during charge, when unfavorable microstructure in the graphite electrode leads to a large overpotential. Here, three-dimensional representations of four different commercial anodes obtained with X-ray tomographic microscopy are statistically analyzed to quantify the microstructural inhomogeneity that is commonly present in lithium ion battery electrodes. Electrochemical simulations on the digitalized microstructures are performed to isolate and understand the influence of different types of microstructural inhomogeneity on battery performance. By understanding how distributions in particle size and shape or slurry and electrode processing cause microstructural inhomogeneity and impact performance, it is possible to determine the extent to which homogeneity should be prioritized for specific applications and how homogeneity could be achieved through smart material selection and processing.},

   abstract = {Using optical mapping and 3D ultrasound, the dynamics and interactions between electrical and mechanical phase singularities were analysed by simultaneously measuring the membrane potential, intracellular calcium concentration and mechanical contractions of the heart during normal rhythm and fibrillation. Cardiac ventricular fibrillation is a life-threatening disturbance in heart rhythm and function. It is thought to be triggered by abnormal patterns of electrical activity forming mechanical vortices within the heart muscle. This activity has never been visualized, only inferred from electrical vortices observed on the surface of the heart. Jan Christoph and colleagues combine high-resolution four-dimensional ultrasound imaging with optical mapping to visualize three-dimensional mechanical waves of contracting and dilating tissue propagating throughout the ventricular muscle during regular rhythm in perfused pig hearts. Upon the induction of ventricular fibrillation, electrical and mechanical scroll waves form within the ventricular wall. The findings confirm the prediction made 30 years ago that three-dimensional vortex-like waves inside the heart drive cardiac arrhythmias. The self-organized dynamics of vortex-like rotating waves, which are also known as scroll waves, are the basis of the formation of complex spatiotemporal patterns in many excitable chemical and biological systems1,2,3,4. In the heart, filament-like phase singularities5,6 that are associated with three-dimensional scroll waves7 are considered to be the organizing centres of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias7,8,9,10,11,12,13. The mechanisms that underlie the onset, maintenance and control14,15,16 of electromechanical turbulence in the heart are inherently three-dimensional phenomena. However, it has not previously been possible to visualize the three-dimensional spatiotemporal dynamics of scroll waves inside cardiac tissues. Here we show that three-dimensional mechanical scroll waves and filament-like phase singularities can be observed deep inside the contracting heart wall using high-resolution four-dimensional ultrasound-based strain imaging. We found that mechanical phase singularities co-exist with electrical phase singularities during cardiac fibrillation. We investigated the dynamics of electrical and mechanical phase singularities by simultaneously measuring the membrane potential, intracellular calcium concentration and mechanical contractions of the heart. We show that cardiac fibrillation can be characterized using the three-dimensional spatiotemporal dynamics of mechanical phase singularities, which arise inside the fibrillating contracting ventricular wall. We demonstrate that electrical and mechanical phase singularities show complex interactions and we characterize their dynamics in terms of trajectories, topological charge and lifetime. We anticipate that our findings will provide novel perspectives for non-invasive diagnostic imaging and therapeutic applications.},

   abstract = {This paper reports on X-ray tomography of a series of coupon samples (5 mm cubes) produced under different process parameters, for laser powder bed fusion of Ti6Al4V. Different process parameters result in different pore formation mechanisms, each with characteristic pore sizes, shapes and locations within the 5 mm cube samples. While keyhole pores, lack of fusion pores and metallurgical pores have been previously identified and illustrated using X-ray tomography, this work extends beyond prior work to show how each of these not only exist in extreme situations but how they vary in size and shape in the transition regimes. It is shown how keyhole mode porosity increases gradually with increasing power, and how this depends on the scan speed. Similarly, lack of fusion pores are shown to occur following scan tracks in situations of poor hatch overlap, or a similar but different distribution of lack of fusion porosity due to large layer height spacing, showing respectively vertical and horizontal lack of fusion pore morphologies. Increased spacing between hatch scan tracks and contour scan tracks is demonstrated to form a near-surface porosity similar to that previously reported for slowing at the end of scan tracks which can cause keyhole mode porosity. Insights from 3D images allow improvements in parameter choices for optimized density of parts produced by laser powder bed fusion, and generally allow a better understanding of the porosity present in additively manufactured parts.},

Here, we report the direct observation and quantification of melt pool variation during the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing process under constant input energy density by in-situ high-speed high-energy x-ray imaging. We show that the melt pool can undergo different melting regimes and both the melt pool dimension and melt pool volume can have orders-of-magnitude change under a constant input energy density. Our analysis shows that the significant melt pool variation cannot be solely explained by the energy dissipation rate. We found that energy absorption changes significantly under a constant input energy density, which is another important cause of melt pool variation. Our further analysis reveals that the significant change in energy absorption originates from the separate roles of laser power and scan speed in depression zone development. The results reported here are important for understanding the laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing process and guiding the development of better metrics for processing parameter design.},

   abstract = {Aortic valve stenosis is associated with an elevated left ventricular pressure and transaortic pressure drop. Clinicians routinely use Doppler ultrasound to quantify aortic valve stenosis severity by estimating this pressure drop from blood velocity. However, this method approximates the peak pressure drop, and is unable to quantify the partial pressure recovery distal to the valve. As pressure drops are flow dependent, it remains difficult to assess the true significance of a stenosis for low-flow low-gradient patients. Recent advances in segmentation techniques enable patient-specific Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of flow through the aortic valve. In this work a simulation framework is presented and used to analyze data of 18 patients. The ventricle and valve are reconstructed from 4D Computed Tomography imaging data. Ventricular motion is extracted from the medical images and used to model ventricular contraction and corresponding blood flow through the valve. Simplifications of the framework are assessed by introducing two simplified CFD models: a truncated time-dependent and a steady-state model. Model simplifications are justified for cases where the simulated pressure drop is above 10 mmHg. Furthermore, we propose a valve resistance index to quantify stenosis severity from simulation results. This index is compared to established metrics for clinical decision making, i.e. blood velocity and valve area. It is found that velocity measurements alone do not adequately reflect stenosis severity. This work demonstrates that combining 4D imaging data and CFD has the potential to provide a physiologically relevant diagnostic metric to quantify aortic valve stenosis severity.},

   abstract = {Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is a 3D printing technology that can print metal parts with complex geometries without the design constraints of traditional manufacturing routes. However, the parts printed by LPBF normally contain many more pores than those made by conventional methods, which severely deteriorates their properties. Here, by combining in-situ high-speed high-resolution synchrotron x-ray imaging experiments and multi-physics modeling, we unveil the dynamics and mechanisms of pore motion and elimination in the LPBF process. We find that the high thermocapillary force, induced by the high temperature gradient in the laser interaction region, can rapidly eliminate pores from the melt pool during the LPBF process. The thermocapillary force driven pore elimination mechanism revealed here may guide the development of 3D printing approaches to achieve pore-free 3D printing of metals. 3D printing pore-free complex metal parts remains a challenge. Here, the authors combine in-situ imaging and simulations to show thermocapillary force can eliminate pores from the melt pool during a laser powder bed fusion process.},

Here, we describe an accurate method for measurement and analysis of spine morphology based on structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and computational geometry in cultured neurons. Surface mesh data converted from SIM images were comparable to data reconstructed from electron microscopic images. Dimensional reduction and machine learning applied to large data sets enabled identification of spine phenotypes caused by genetic mutations in key signal transduction molecules. This method, combined with time-lapse live imaging and glutamate uncaging, could detect plasticity-related changes in spine head curvature. The results suggested that the concave surfaces of spines are important for the long-term structural stabilization of spines by synaptic adhesion molecules. We are currently short of methods that can extract objective parameters of dendritic spines useful for their categorization. Authors present in this study an automatic analytical pipeline for spine geometry using 3D-structured illumination microscopy, which can effectively extract many geometrical parameters of dendritic spines without bias and automatically categorize spine population based on their morphological features},

   abstract = {Laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing is an emerging 3D printing technique for the fabrication of advanced metal components. Widespread adoption of it and similar additive technologies is hampered by poor understanding of laser-metal interactions under such extreme thermal regimes. Here, we elucidate the mechanism of pore formation and liquid-solid interface dynamics during typical laser powder bed fusion conditions using in situ X-ray imaging and multi-physics simulations. Pores are revealed to form during changes in laser scan velocity due to the rapid formation then collapse of deep keyhole depressions in the surface which traps inert shielding gas in the solidifying metal. We develop a universal mitigation strategy which eliminates this pore formation process and improves the geometric quality of melt tracks. Our results provide insight into the physics of laser-metal interaction and demonstrate the potential for science-based approaches to improve confidence in components produced by laser powder bed fusion. Laser-matter interactions during laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing remain poorly understood.

We evaluate our work by curating test sets of voxels in the absence of a complete ground truth mask.

The understanding of the physical phenomena during the interaction of a laser beam and powder-blown deposition is limited and requires in-situ monitoring to capture the influences of process parameters on powder flow, absorptivity of laser energy into the substrate, melt pool dynamics and porosity formation. This study introduces a piezo-driven powder deposition system that allows for imaging of individual powder particles that flow into a scanning melt pool.

Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.

Here we have developed a full microstructure-resolved 3D model using a novel X-ray nano-computed tomography (CT) dual-scan superimposition technique that captures features of the carbon-binder domain. This elucidates how LiB performance is markedly affected by microstructural heterogeneities, particularly under high rate conditions. The elongated shape and wide size distribution of the active particles not only affect the lithium-ion transport but also lead to a heterogeneous current distribution and non-uniform lithiation between particles and along the through-thickness direction. Building on these insights, we propose and compare potential graded-microstructure designs for next-generation battery electrodes. To guide manufacturing of electrode architectures, in-situ X-ray CT is shown to reliably reveal the porosity and tortuosity changes with incremental calendering steps. The 3D microstructure of the electrode predominantly determines the electrochemical performance of Li-ion batteries. Here, the authors show that the microstructural heterogeneities lead to non-uniform Li insertion and current distribution while graded-microstructures improve the performance.},
